Let $V$ is Banach space and $A:V\rightarrow V$ is a linear operator. Further let one suppose that the resolvent operator 
$R_\lambda(A)=(A-\lambda\, I)^{-1}$ for $A$ is known explicitly. The aim of this report is to show how to calculate the resolvent operator
$R_\lambda(A^m)=(A^m-\lambda\, I)^{-1}$ for arbitrary natural degree $m$ of operator $A$ using expression for $R_\lambda(A)$. Examples demonstrating this procedure for both bounded and unbounded operators have been done.
