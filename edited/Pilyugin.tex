In this talk, we discuss various relations between the inverse
shadowing property of discrete dynamical systems on a smooth
closed manifold and invariant measures.

First, we introduce the so-called ergodic inverse shadowing property (Birk\-hoff
averages of continuous functions along an exact trajectory and the approximating 
one are close). We demonstrate that this property implies the continuity of the set of invariant measures in the Hausdorff metric. We show that the class of systems 
with ergodic inverse shadowing is quite broad; it includes all diffeomorphisms 
with hyperbolic nonwandering sets. 

Second, we study the so-called individual inverse shadowing 
(any exact trajectory can be traced by approximate ones, but this 
shadowing is not uniform with respect to the initial point of the trajectory).
We demonstrate that, in terms of invariant measures,
this property is closely related to structural stability 
and $\Omega$-stability of diffeomorphisms.

The main results are published in~\cite{KP}.
